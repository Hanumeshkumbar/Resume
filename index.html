    <h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
    <p><b>Intern</b></p>
    <p> LEOS, ISRO OCTOBER 2023–NOVEMBER 2023</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Designed and implemented user-friendly GUI for CMOS sensor image
            readout. </li>
        <li>Conducted thorough research and analysis to optimize the image
            readout process, reducing the time required by 15%.</li>
        <li>Collaborated with the team to troubleshoot and resolve technical
            issues, ensuring seamless functionality of the GUI design.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Projects</b></p>
    <p>Men's Salon Management System</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Men's Salon Management System (MSMS) project focuses on
            modernizing appointment management in barber shops by
            addressing challenges such as scheduling conflicts, long wait times,
            and missed opportunities. By utilizing advanced technology and
            intuitive design, MSMS streamlines the appointment lifecycle—from
            booking to service delivery—enhancing both customer satisfaction
            and operational efficiency
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Identification of Fake Indian Currency Using Android App</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a system using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
            (CNN) to detect counterfeit Indian currency. The application allows
            secure user login, real-time currency scanning, and provides a
            confidence score for authenticity. Leveraged TensorFlow/Keras for
            model training, Android Studio for application development, and
            cloud deployment for scalability. Implemented robust preprocessing
            techniques to handle diverse conditions and ensure high accuracy.</li>
